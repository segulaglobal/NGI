        <p>The Young Women’s Coding and Leadership Training Program marked a significant milestone with the successful graduation of 25 participants, who completed an intensive seven-week training focused on equipping young women with digital skills, coding expertise, and leadership development. The event, held on 14th September 2024 at the HOPin Academy premises, showcased the participants’ achievements and underscored the project’s role in promoting gender equality in Northern Ghana.</p>
<p>The program, now in its second cohort, aims to bridge the digital divide by providing underprivileged young women with practical skills in areas such as coding, digital marketing, search engine optimization (SEO), leadership and entrepreneurship. Participants, hailing from diverse backgrounds, including the University for Development Studies (UDS), Tamale Technical University, and senior high school graduates, underwent rigorous training designed to empower them with tools to excel in the digital economy.</p>
<p>The training initiative was launched by the Northern Girl Initiative, a local non-profit dedicated to the social and economic empowerment of women and girls. The organization’s Executive Director, Ruka Yaro De-Liman, emphasized the importance of this initiative, stating, “We are not only training these young women to code but also to become leaders and entrepreneurs in their communities. Through this program, we are creating a generation of change-makers who will drive development in Northern Ghana.”</p>
<p><img src="/assets/blog/NGI-2-1536x1023.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The program began with an inspiring orientation session, setting the tone for seven weeks of intensive learning and growth. As part of their experiential learning, participants visited the Afritech Hub on 12th September 2024, where they interacted with professionals in the tech industry and explored opportunities for collaboration and innovation in the field of technology.menstrual hygiene management.</p>
<p>A key highlight of the program was the contribution of Muhsin Ismail, the newly appointed Training Facilitaor, who, along with his team, provided invaluable mentorship and guidance. As a passionate advocate for gender equality and tech empowerment, Muhsin’s commitment to the participants was evident throughout the program, motivating the young women to strive for excellence.</p>
<p>One of the standout graduates of the program was the Assistant Training Coordinator, Miss Mohammed Nazifa Boakye Anima, a beneficiary of the first cohort. Having been invited to support this year’s training, she served as a role model, showing the incoming cohort the transformative potential of the program.</p>
<p>At the graduation ceremony, guest speakers led by the Chairperson Hajia Alima Sajito Saeed, the Executive Director for Savana Women Integrated Development Agency (SWIDA) Ghana,  praised the participants for their dedication and hard work. They emphasized the critical role of digital skills in today’s global economy, encouraging the graduates to use their newfound expertise to create opportunities, not only for themselves but also for their communities.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/blog/SAGITO-1536x1023.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>In her closing remarks, Ms De-Liman reaffirmed Northern Girl Initiative’s commitment to fostering inclusive tech education. “Our mission goes beyond providing skills. We are creating a network of empowered young women who will contribute to the social and economic development of Northern Ghana,” she said. “The graduates from this cohort will be at the forefront of this movement.”</p>
<p>As the event ended, the graduates received certificates in recognition of their achievements. With their new digital and leadership skills, they are now equipped to tackle the challenges of the modern workforce, with many expressing aspirations to start their own tech-based ventures or seek employment in leading companies across Ghana.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, Northern Girl Initiative plans to expand the Young Women’s Coding and Leadership Training Program, with hopes to reach more communities and provide training for the next generation of women leaders in tech. With support from partners and stakeholders, the organization is determined to scale the program, ensuring that more young women in Northern Ghana can access these life-changing opportunities.</p>
<p>The program’s impact on the region is already evident, and as one participant put it, “This training has opened doors I never thought possible. I am now confident to pursue a career in tech and contribute to the growth of my community.”</p>
