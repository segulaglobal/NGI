That's why our founders make it a priority to gather with volunteers for open dialogues, strategic planning for NGI program growth, and good old-fashioned celebrations of collective progress made.

This month, we held an impactful "Founders Meet Volunteers" event kicking off 2023 engagement on a high. 

Every volunteer received personalized certificates of honor from our founders in appreciation of the tangible difference they are making through dedicating time to Northern girls.

We all left feeling energized about deepening meaningful work together in the year ahead - volunteers happy to learn of new initiatives their skills can help actualize to further change, and founders re-inspired by the force of compassion surrounding our cause.

> The power of community allows big visions to blossom! 

We are endlessly grateful for all who feel called to improve girls' access to education and opportunity through volunteering. Here is to another milestone year guided by caring individuals ready to go the extra mile to empower Northern Ghana's next generation of female leaders.
