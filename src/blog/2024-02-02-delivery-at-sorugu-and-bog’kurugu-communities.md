#### Ensuring Girls Never Miss School Days Due to Lack of Resources

Menstrual health should never pose barriers to any girl’s education. Yet in Northern Ghana, many adolescents miss crucial school days each month due to lack of access to sanitary products. The inability to afford pads, tampons and underwear contributes to absenteeism as well as lowered confidence and performance for girls still braving attendance on their periods without proper resources.

The Northern Girl Initiative remains dedicated to eliminating this injustice through our accessible health and hygiene initiatives. We recently took delivery of 400 “Days for Girls” reusable sanitary kits to distribute ensuring girls can stay actively focused on learning and growth throughout their cycles.

Our team first visited Sorugu and Bog’kurugu communities, gifting the kits containing panties, reusable pads, towels and more to schoolgirls and mothers. By providing them with resources, these girls can now manage menstruation healthfully without anxiety over affordability hindering their futures.

> We say again and again, when a girl is supported, entire communities are lifted!
