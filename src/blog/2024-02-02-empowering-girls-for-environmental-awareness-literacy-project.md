In addition, by engaging the girls with environmental sustainability topics like renewable energy, conservation and waste reduction, we hope to empower them to become champions for our shared climate. Learning about these solutions sparks their interest to make a positive difference in the world.

We believe this fusion curriculum will nurture the next generation of female leaders and advocates.

>  By linking lessons with sustainability concepts, these girls gain essential communication skills and knowledge to speak out for issues that matter to them. 

Get involved to support this project! Together, we will cultivate passionate young women across northern Ghana.
