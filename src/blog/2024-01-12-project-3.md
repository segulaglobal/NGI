This week, our InnoHub on Wheels team arrived at Moglaa LA Junior High School in Ghana’s Savelugu District to facilitate another dynamic digital literacy workshop. As part of our commitment to provide practical tech skills training for youth in under-resourced schools, lessons focused on Microsoft Office fundamentals.

We were met with boundless enthusiasm from students as we delivered the hands-on sessions, with staff showing outstanding support helping their pupils grow tech capabilities. Young learners practiced tangible digital skills like creating folders and files, entering data onto Excel sheets.

We remain committed to reaching schools like Moglaa LA across Northern Region with on-the-ground ICT education ensuring no student gets left out of Ghana’s accelerating digital transformation. It takes consistent grassroots effort, but tech access and understanding unlocks opportunities. We're honored to open doors for the innovators and changemakers of tomorrow!
