Following an insightful orientation on October 11th, the cohort commenced intensive training on October 27th at our Tamale center. As hands-on guidance gets underway, we aim for graduates to implement sustainable initiatives addressing economic, health or social issues back in their villages leveraging freshly honed digital acumen.
