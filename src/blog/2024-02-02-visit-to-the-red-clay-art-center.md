## Sparking Creativity and Innovation Through Exploring Local Art

As part of our ICT skills training program for girls across Northern Region schools, we believe exposing students to diverse industries, creators, and innovators in their own communities plays a powerful role shaping mindsets and possibilities. 

> Students learn how technology intersects with groundbreaking work happening right in their backyards - often sparked by other young changemakers imagining a better future.

We recently climaxed an intensive **ICT course for girls from Zogbele Block C Junior High School and Al Markaziya Junior High School** with an inspirational ***field trip to Tamale's Red Clay Art Center.***

Here, students witnessed the beauty of reimagining "trash" materials like plastic, rubber and metals as they toured the center's galleries of upcycled art. 

We held an impactful discussion on how digital design also involves visualizing innovative solutions by approaching problems differently.

The trip reinforced that groundbreaking digital transformation begins with courage to try new things and dream bigger dreams for the future.

As always, we're sharing photos capturing the curiosity, wonder and motivation of girls ready to create ripples of progress across Ghana!
