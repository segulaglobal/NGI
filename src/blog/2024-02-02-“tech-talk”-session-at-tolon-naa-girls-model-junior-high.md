When the 2023 International Women’s Day theme was announced, 

>  “DigitALL: Innovation and technology for gender equality” 

we instantly knew one of our biggest education focuses for the girls of Northern Ghana this year. Under our school partnership program, we’re providing practical tech and coding workshops to spark girls’ interest in exploring science, engineering, math, and beyond.

Gaining digital literacy and envisioning STEM pathways early on can massively shape their professional opportunities and earning potential as empowered, tech-savvy young women. As studies indicate extra hours of computer exposure in school correlates with an increase in wages later on!

So this International Women’s Day, we held our inaugural “Tech Talk” session at Tolon Naa Girls Model Junior High, bringing the tech world to inspire the next generation. The girls had a chance to see some of the coding works of one of our female team members.

This is only the beginning! We aim to reach 400 girls across Northern Region schools this year through hands-on tech and ICT workshops - unambiguously asserting that STEM interest and talent has no gender.

> The future remains fully unwritten for our young change makers; our role is to help them access the tools to craft it purposefully.
