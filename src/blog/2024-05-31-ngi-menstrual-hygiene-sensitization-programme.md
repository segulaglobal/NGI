### Chanzegu, Kumbungu District – Commemorating Menstrual Hygiene Day 2024

In a bid to commemorate Menstrual Hygiene Day 2024, Northern Girl Initiative (NGI) organized a groundbreaking girls' empowerment workshop at Chanzegu DA JHS on May 29th. This event aimed to sensitize young girls about the importance of maintaining good hygiene during their menstrual periods and impart practical skills for making reusable sanitary pads using locally available materials.

### Empowering Girls with Knowledge and Skills

The workshop was both informative and hands-on, seeing enthusiastic participation from the students. During the session, girls learned crucial knowledge about menstrual health and hygiene, a topic often overlooked in many communities. The interactive training focused on empowering the girls with the ability to produce reusable sanitary pads, providing a sustainable and cost-effective solution to menstrual hygiene management.

### Positive Impact and Participant Feedback

The impact of the workshop was palpable, as many participants expressed their gratitude for the skills they had acquired. One attendee shared, "This training has been very helpful. In the future, some of us will be able to start businesses making these reusable pads. This will make them easily accessible and affordable for girls in our villages."

Mariam, a particularly inspired participant, shared her plans to extend the knowledge she gained. "I am going to teach my two sisters and other young women in my community how to make these pads. It's a skill that can really make a difference," she said.

### Fostering Entrepreneurship and Self-Reliance

The workshop not only equipped the girls with practical skills but also fostered a sense of entrepreneurship and self-reliance. By learning to make their own reusable pads, the girls are now better prepared to manage their menstrual health in an affordable and sustainable way, reducing dependency on expensive and often unavailable commercial products.

### Breaking the Stigma and Promoting Education

Northern Girl's initiative is a significant step towards breaking the stigma surrounding menstruation and promoting menstrual hygiene education in the Kumbungu District. The organization plans to hold similar workshops in other communities, aiming to reach even more young girls with this life-changing knowledge and skill.
